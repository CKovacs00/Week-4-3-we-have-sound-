    <!-- The UAT Space team finished thier website project with record  time, so they decided in their free time
    and to make it look like they still needed to do work, they decided to insert a craps table. The put it on the main 
page simply because they could. they knew it was so simple to disable they could simply remove this in an instant. So for now 
they decided to have fun and continue betting on random numbers on a website.-->
